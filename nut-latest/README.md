# Home Assistant add-on: NUT-Latest / Network UPS Tools (Latest version)

A ["Network UPS Tools"][addon-nut] add-on based on Debian Stable is already available from the
"Home Assistant Community Add-ons" repository.  However, the version of NUT in Debian Stable is
typically significantly outdated.

For users who need (or want to test with) a newer version of NUT, this add-on is based on the
"Network UPS Tools" add-on but it provides the version of NUT in Debian Unstable (Sid).

For information on installing and using this add-on, see [this add-on's documentation](DOCS.md).

For information on using NUT in Home Assistant, see the
[NUT HA Integration documentation][nut-ha-docs].
